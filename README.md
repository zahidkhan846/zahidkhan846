- 👋 Hi, I’m Zahid Khan.

- 🚀 Full Stack MEARN/MEAN/MEVN DevOps Developer and Gamer 🎮

- 👨‍💻 I'm passionate about creating cutting-edge web applications using the MEARN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular or React, Node.js) and MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) or MEVN (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js) stacks. I thrive on tackling complex challenges and transforming ideas into robust, scalable, and user-friendly software.

- ⚙️ As a DevOps enthusiast, I enjoy building and maintaining streamlined development pipelines, enabling seamless code integration, continuous testing, and automated deployment. I believe that DevOps practices are the key to efficient collaboration and successful software delivery.

- 🎮 When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in the gaming world. Gaming is not only my favorite pastime but also a great source of inspiration for innovative problem-solving and creative thinking in my development projects.

- 🌱 I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies and frameworks, so you might find me experimenting with the latest tools and techniques.

- 📫 Let's connect! Feel free to reach out for collaboration, discussions, or gaming chats.
